# SMC Project

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project analyzes sentiments from tweets using various models, including TextBlob, BERT, VADER, and RoBERTa.

## Visualizations
Screenshots of the visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Future Work
In future iterations of this project, we aim to enhance sentiment analysis by incorporating additional models, exploring ensemble techniques, and refining sentiment mapping based on deeper linguistic features. Additionally, further investigation into model disagreements will be conducted to understand the nuances behind varying sentiment predictions. Plans include applying advanced techniques such as fine-tuning models specifically for this dataset and integrating user feedback to improve model accuracy.
